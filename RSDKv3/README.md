# Snake 2 RSDKv3
The RSDKv3 port of Snake 2. Originally released on 7/8/2023 in the The Doug District (DougDoug Discord server) and Retro Engine Modding Server, reuploaded here for archival purposes. Despite my best efforts, this did not win Game of the Year.

Can be loaded in the decomp as a mod with the included `mod.ini` file or via Data Folder Mode. Enabling `HardwareRenderer` in `settings.ini` is recommended, otherwise the credits won't appear properly.
