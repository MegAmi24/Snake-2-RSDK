In the dystopian city of Flavortown, Guy Fieri, now a 
mighty snake, fights against time and the system. The
food has been taken over by a corrupt corporate
entity, turning it into red power cubes. These cubes
increase Guy's size and energy, but they're a scarce
resource, heavily guarded, and dangerous to reach.
Will he be able to conquer the system or will he
succumb to its oppressive mechanisms? The path is
treacherous, the stakes are high, but our Flavortown
hero won't give up!
